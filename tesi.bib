  abstract = {The notion of ``evolvability'' ---
	 the ability of a population to produce variants fitter than any yet
	 existing --- is developed as it applies to genetic algorithms. A
	 theoretical analysis of the dynamics of genetic programming predicts the
	 existence of a novel, emergent selection phenomenon: the evolution of
	 evolvability. This is produced by the proliferation, within programs, of
	 blocks of code that have a higher chance of increasing fitness when
	 added to programs. Selection can then come to mold the variational
	 aspects of the way evolved programs are represented. A model of code
	 proliferation within programs is analyzed to illustrate this effect. The
	 mathematical and conceptual framework includes: the definition of
	 evolvability as a measure of performance for genetic algorithms;
	 application of Price's Covariance and Selection Theorem to show how the
	 fitness function, representation, and genetic operators must interact
	 to produce evolvability --- namely, that genetic operators produce
	 offspring with fitnesses specifically correlated with their parent's
	 fitnesses; how blocks of code emerge as a new level of replicator,
	 proliferating as a function of their ''constructional fitness'', which
	 is distinct from their schema fitness; and how programs may change
	 from innovative code to conservative code as the populations mature.
	 Several new selection techniques and genetic operators are proposed
	 in order to give better control over the evolution of evolvability
	 and improved evolutionary performance. Copyright 1996 Lee Altenberg},
