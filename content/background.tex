In this Chapter we include an overview of the main research areas related to this thesis. The Stream Reasoning research context, to which this thesis belongs, is introduced in Section \ref{sec:sfp}. It has the aim of unifying the Semantic Web research area, we briefly present in Section \ref{sec:sw} and The Information Flow Processing (IFP) research one, described in Section \ref{sec:ifp}. 

This thesis proposes \namens, an open source framework for the Systematic Comparative Research Approach. Section \ref{sec:empirical-research} contains the state of the are of the Empirical Research in the Computer Science. It is worth to note that Software Testing and Benchmarking are the two most relevant approach to empirically evaluate software systems. For this reason we include in this Chapter an introduction about Software Testing in Section \ref{sec:software-testing} and one about Benchmarking in Section \ref{sec:benchmarking}.

\section{Semantic Web}\label{sec:sw}

The Semantic Web (SW) is the World Wide Web extension  that  provides a common framework to share and reuse data across applications, enterprise, and community boundaries. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), supervises the development of proposed Semantic Web standards. A large number of researchers and industrial partners collaborate, led by the W3C, for this survey.

"The Web can reach its full potential if it becomes a place where data can be processed by automated tools as well as people". [W3C, 2001]

In the Semantic Web vision, i.e. the Web 3.0,  the information can be processed and manipulated by machines. SW can give to the information a well defined meaning. The way to reach this goal is adding a new layer of meta-data to the existing documents and data. The semantic definition of data and documents enables to understand and respond to complex human needs. The outcome of this vision is an evolution to a new Web, where intelligent agents can browse data on behalf of the user and make knowledge easier to be reached.


\begin{figure}[tbh]

	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/semantic_web_stack}
	\caption{Semantic Web Stack} 
  	\label{fig:semantic-web-stack}
\end{figure}
 

Semantic Web world involves several technologies. Due to the complexity of the concept, the W3C proposed a layered approach, presented in Figure \ref{fig:semantic-web-stack}, in which each level contains a set of standards for semantic technologies:

The first level of the Semantic Web stack includes  two standard of World Wide Web:
\begin{itemize}
\item  The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)  and Internationalized Resource Identifier(IRI), which guarantee the interoperability between heterogeneous systems. They stay at the lowest level
\item  The Unicode standard is a character encoding standard to represent and manipulate text in many languages.
%\item  The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a wide-spread standard for data exchange in the Web that states the basic syntax level. In the SW stack it is build on top of URI and Unicode. 
\end{itemize}

On the top of them, the basic syntax level is provided by the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), a wide-spread standard for data exchange in the Web. The XML parsers support the lower-level syntax checking of the Semantic Web documents. However, the XML standard is not enough for the data exchange in the semantic web, because it is suited to recognize syntax, but not equivalent models. For this reason, three middle layers are required to ensure the semantic interoperability:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a language for expressing data models, which are usually encoded in XML
\item RDF Schema (RDFS) defines a vocabulary for describing classes and properties of RDF resources.
\item The Web Ontology Language (OWL) extends the RDF Schema by adding advanced concepts in order to facilitate a more realistic representation of knowledge based on the RDF resources.
\end{itemize} 

Finally, technologies at the top layers are not yet standardized or implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Rule Interchange Format (RIF) or SWRL allows knowledge inference from existing data.
\item Cryptography is important to verify if semantic web statements are coming from trusted source.
\item Trust involves the trustworthiness and reliability of the data.
\item User interface is the final layer that will enable humans to use Semantic
\end{itemize} 

Last but not least, another important standard covering multiple layers is the official Semantic Web Query Language: SPARQL,  the official query language for the SW and a W3C Recommendation since January 2008. 

In the following subsections, we will present some basic concepts of the Semantic Web:  RDF in Subsection \ref{sec:rdf},  OWL in Subsection \ref{sec:owl}, Linked Data in Subsection \ref{sec:ldata} and SPARQL language \ref{sec:sparql}

\subsection{Resource Description Framework}\label{sec:rdf}

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is the W3C standard for data interchange on the Semantic Web \cite{rdfconcepts}. Through RDF we can describe a conceptual model of information in any given domain of knowledge. Information is represented in the statements form subject-predicate-object. In general a statement is composed by three different resources, indeed statements are also called triples and set of triples is called a graph. More formally, we provide the definition of RDF triples and RDF graphs:

\textbf{Definition}: Let $I$, $B$ and $L$ be three pairwise disjoint sets, defined as IRIs, Blank Nodes and Literals, respectively. A triple \[ (s, p, o) \in (I \cup B) × I × (I \cup B \cup L) \] is  an \textit{RDF triple}, while a set of \textit{RDF triples} is called an R\textit{DF grap}h.

Notice that:
\begin{itemize}
\item IRIs are Internationalized Resource Identifiers, an extension of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) that enlarge the character set from ASCII to Unicode.  IRIs provide the linking structure of the Web and allow a globally connection between any different \textit{RDF graphs}
\item Literals are constant values, represented by character strings, which can be associated to a XML Schema datatype. 
\item Blank nodes represent anonymous resources, usually resources that group a number of other resources and which are never directly referenced.
\end{itemize}

The Resource Description Framework has several possible rap presentations.

The most natural representation for triples is the N3 notation, which consists in explicit each triple in the form:
 \[<subjectIRI> <predicateIRI> <objectIRI>/objectLiteral\]
 
The official syntax for RDF models is RDF/XML, which is an XML dialect for describing RDF. Many applications exploit the XML Language in the Web, indeed the XML document validation of the basic syntax of RDF/XML is possible trough the RDF/XML standard schema. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML, caption=An example of a simple RDF/XML document:, label=code:rdf]
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
 		 xmlsn:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
 		 xmlns:foaf="http://XMLns.com/foaf/0.1/">
  <rdf:Description rdf:ID="marvin">
    <foaf:name>Marvin</foaf:name>
     <rdf:type>
        <rdfs:Class rdf:about="#ManicDepressiveRobot"/>
     </rdf:type>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
\end{lstlisting}

The Code Snippet \ref{code:rdf} contains an example of a simple RDF/XML document. Each RDF/XML document starts with an unique rdf:RDF element and the definition of the useful namespaces (lines 1-3). The rdf:Description tag (lines 4-9) represents an RDF Statement and it includes the subject of the statement, in our case Marvin. Inside the rdf:Description element we define two predicates: foaf:name (line 5) which contains an object literal, a string with the name of the resource; rdf:type (lines 6-8), a special predicate, which relates the individual resource to its class. In this case Marvin is an individual of the class ManicDepressiveRobot (line 7).

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/rdf-graph}
	\caption{Semantic Web Stack} 
  	\label{fig:rdf-graph}
\end{figure}

Last but not least, Figure \ref{fig:rdf-graph} shows the graphical representation of an RDF model as RDF graph:  subjects and objects are the graph nodes and proprieties are represented as edges connecting a subject to an object.

\subsection{Web Ontology Language}\label{sec:owl}

The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is the W3C standard for describing rich and complex knowledge about resources, groups of resources, and relations between resources, or more formally an \textit{Ontology}. Tom Gruber define an ontology as \textit{a specification of a conceptualization}\footnote{http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/kst/what-is-an-ontology.html}. Practically, it can be a set of Description Logic axioms which tries to represent a fragment of reality. 

OWL is obtained extending the RDF Schema Language with additional language constructs and some constrain on the usege of RDF(S)  ones. The aim of these constrains is to restrain the language to a subset of First Order Logic. Different constrains define different levels of expressiveness and complexity. The W3C has standardized three different OWL dialects, presented in order of increasing level of complexity
\begin{itemize}
\item OWL Lite - used to classify hierarchies and to model simple constraints. Being an equivalent of the SHIF description logic, it has the lower formal complexity in the group.
\item OWL DL - provides the user with maximum possible expressiveness, while retaining the computational completeness. This last quality is enforced by the equivalence with the SROIQ[Dn] Description Logic.
\item OWL Full - the user has the complete syntactic freedom with RDF, but there is no computational guarantee about the termination of the inferring procedure.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML, caption=An example of a simple OWL DL RDF/XML document:, label=code:owl]
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
 xmlsn:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
 xmlns:foaf="http://XMLns.com/foaf/0.1/">
  <owl:Class rdf:ID="ManicDepressiveRobot">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Robot"/>
    <rdfs:subClassOf>
      <owl:Restriction>
        <owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#hasMood"/>
        <owl:minCardinality>2</owl:minCardinality>
      </owl:Restriction>
    </rdfs:subClassOf>
  </owl:Class>
\end{lstlisting}

OWL can be serialized in the RDF/XML syntax. In the Code Snippet \ref{code:owl}, we use OWL DL to describe the Class of ManicDepressiveRobot, which are a SubClass of Robot that has for at least two Moods. The owl:Class tag (lines 4-12) is a shortcut to represent an RDF Statement about a resource with a rdf:type of owl:Class. The subject of the statement is the resource ManicDepressiveRobot, which represents the class of individual Manic Depressive Robots. This statement has two predicates, both of the type rdfs:subClassOf. The first predicate (line 5) relates the OWL class ManicDepressiveRobot to its super-class, the resource Robot. The second predicate (lines 6-11) states that ManicDepressiveRobot is a subclass of the OWL restriction class, which contains all the individuals that are in relationship hasMood (line 8) with at least 2 resources (line 9).


\subsection{Linked Data}\label{sec:ldata}

The Linked Data concept indicates a set of best practices in publishing and connecting Semantic Web data. Bizer, the Linked Data creator, defines the term as follow:

\begin{quote}
Linked Data refers to data published on the Web in such a way that it is machine-readable, its meaning is explicitly defined, it is linked to other external readable, defined, data sets, and can in turn be linked to from external data sets.[Bizer et al., 2009]
\end{quote} 

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/lod}
	\caption{Linked Data Cloud August 2014 From lod-cloud.net} 
  	\label{fig:lod}
\end{figure}

Datasets that are published according to the Linked Data principles can be navigated using Semantic Web browsers. Figure \ref{fig:lod} presents  Linked Data Cloud updated to August 2014. It is the connected graph which comprises all the dataset published according to the LD principles. Each node of the graph represents a dataset, while each edge represents the connections between datasets.

The number datasets that follow the Linked Data paradigm is increasing every day, and among the most important of them we can cite DBpedia, which wraps Wikipedia articles into a Semantic Web compliant form. Moreover, several governments, like the UK government\footnote{http://data.gov.uk/}, decide to publish their public data and connect them to the Linked Data cloud. 

\subsection{SPARQL}\label{sec:sparql}


The SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) are, since January 2008, the W3C standard query language for retrieving data in RDF format \cite{prudhommeaux_sparql_2008}.

The SPARQL query language was initially designed to meet the requirements identified in the RDF Data Access Use Cases and Requirements. Only successively it has been formalized through the definition of an official algebra, developed as an evolution of previous RDF query languages such as rdfDB, RDQL, and SeRQL.

Recently, a W3C working draft describing the new version of SPARQL, has been released \footnote{http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/.}. SPARQL 1.1, this is the name of the new relase, is completely compatible with the SPARQL specification, but has some new additional features, like aggregates, subqueries, negation and project expressions, i.e. the possibility to use expressions in the SELECT clause. These features were already part of several implementations of SPARQL, for example in the ARQ query engine. 

RDF is a directed labelled graph data format, thus SPARQL is defined as a graph-matching query language. The SPARQL language specifies four different query variations for different purposes:
\begin{itemize}
\item SELECT query: used to extract a set of variables and their matching values, called set of mappings in the table format.
\item CONSTRUCT query: used to provide an RDF graph created directly from the results of the query.
\item ASK query: used to provide a simple Boolean value expressing if there are any matches in the graph.
\item DESCRIBE query: used to extract an RDF graph based on the infor- mation related to the retrieved resources.
\end{itemize}

Each of these query forms takes a WHERE block to describe and restrict the searched graph pattern using keywords like FILTER, OPTIONAL, AND,or UNION.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL, caption=An example of a simple SPARQL query , keywords={PREFIX,SELECT,WHERE,ORDER,BY, LIMIT }, label=code:sparql]
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> 
SELECT ?person ?name
WHERE {
?person a foaf:Person.
?person foaf:name ?name }
ORDER BY ?name 
LIMIT 3
\end{lstlisting}

The code snippet \ref{code:sparql} contains a simple example of SPARQL Select query. In general the structure of such queries (SELECT) consists of five clauses:
\begin{itemize}
\item PREFIX: The PREFIX keyword associates a prefix label with an IRI. A qualified name is a prefix label and a local part, separated by a colon, which is mapped to an IRI.
\item SELECT: The SELECT keyword specify the form of returning vari- ables and their combinations by introducing new variable.
\item FROM: The FROM allows a query to specify an RDF dataset by reference.
\item WHERE: The WHERE clause provides the graph pattern to match against the data graph. The graph pattern can be in different form of simple graph pattern, group graph pattern, optional graph pattern, alternative graph pattern. Different keywords can be used in this clause such as OPTIONAL (for optional patterns), UNION (for unions of patterns), FILTER (for filtering patterns).
\item Solution modifiers: this clause use different keywords like ORDER BY, LIMIT,. . . in order to modify the result of the query.
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Reasoning}\label{sec:reasoning}

\section{Information Flow Processing}\label{sec:ifp}

The Information Flow Processing (IFP) domain includes all the application which face the users need to collect information  flows produced by multiple, distributed sources. IFP applications extract new knowledge from the information flow as soon as it is collected, processing the information in a timely way.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/ifp}
	\caption{IFP general Model proposed in \cite{Cugola:2012:PFI:2187671.2187677}  } 
  	\label{fig:ifp}
\end{figure}

We call IFP engine \textit{a tool capable of timely processing large amount of information, which flows from the peripheral to the center of the system} \cite{Cugola:2012:PFI:2187671.2187677}. Years of research on IFP have developed two main models: the Data Stream Processing Model (DSMS) \cite{Babcock:2002:MID:543613.543615} and the Complex Event Processing (CEP) Model \cite{Luckham:2001:PEI:515781}. We details this two models of IFP respectively for DSMS in Subsection \ref{sec:dsms} and for CEP in Subsection \ref{sec:cep}

Figure \ref{fig:ifp} shows the general IFP Engine model proposed in \cite{Cugola:2012:PFI:2187671.2187677}. As the figure shows, the IFP engine receives as input information flow and it processes the flow item as soon as they are available. A set of processing rules define the processing, by specifying how to filter, combine, and aggregate different flows of information. Item by item the IFP generates a new flow, which represents the output of the engine.

IFP processing is led by two central concepts:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{Data streams} - which are (potentially infinite) sequences of timestamped data items (a.k.a., events) ordered by the temporal dimension. Notice that the velocity of data stream prevents secondary memory usage. 

\item \textit{Windows} - which allow to cope with the infinite nature of streams, moving from infinite sequences to finite (and processable) sets of information items. Sliding windows are one of the most studied classes of window: intuitively, a sliding window creates a view over a portion of the stream that changes (slides) over time. Time-based sliding windows are sliding windows that create the window and slide it accordingly to time constraints: they are defined by two parameters, the width $\omega$	 – i.e. the time range that has to be considered by the window – and the slide $\beta$ – i.e. how much time the window moves ahead when it slides.

\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Data Stream Management System}\label{sec:dsms}
The DSMS research field  views this problem as an evolution of traditional data processing. The IFP problem is described as processing streams of data coming from different sources to produce new data streams as an output. A Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) extends the traditional DBMSs, in particular for the following considerations:

Moreover DSMS are different from DBSM because: 
\begin{itemize}
\item streams are usually unbounded, while tables are not
\item assumption on data arrival order and rate can not be formulated
\item size and time constraints make hard, probable impossible, storing and processing data stream; one-time processing is the typical mechanism used to deal with streams
\end{itemize} 

Practically, DSMSs present many differences from traditional DBSM: first of all, DBMSs are designed to work on persistent data, while DSMSs are focused into transient data management, because data are continuously updated. The second main difference regards queries: DBMSs queries are run once and then return a complete answer. DSMSs queries instead are execute standing queries, which continuously answer as new data arrives. 

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/dsms}
	\caption{DSMS Model proposed in \cite{Babu:2001:CQO:603867.603884}  } 
  	\label{fig:dsms}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:dsms} reports a general DSMSs model proposed in \cite{Babu:2001:CQO:603867.603884}. The aim the model is to explicit several architectural choices and their consequences. A DSMS is modelled as a set of standing queries $Q$ and one or more input streams, the DSMS can produce four outputs \cite{Cugola:2012:PFI:2187671.2187677}:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{Stream} - it is formed by all the elements of the answer that are produced once and never changed;
\item The \textit{Store} - it is filled with parts of the answer that may be changed or removed at a certain point in the future. The Stream and the Store together define the current answer to queries Q;
\item The \textit{Scratch} - it represents the working memory of the system, i.e. a repository where it is possible to store data that is not part of the answer, but that may be useful to compute the answer;
\item The \textit{Throw} - it is a sort of recycle bin, used to throw away unneeded tuples.
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/cql}
	\caption{CLQ DSMS Model proposed in  \cite{Arasu2006} } 
  	\label{fig:cql}
\end{figure}


Moreover, the DB group of the Stanford University proposed the CQL stream processing model, which defines a generic DSMS through three classes of operators \cite{Arasu2006}.

Figure \ref{fig:cql} present the composed system, the DSMS:  

The Stream-to-Relation (S2R) operator is from the first class of operators that manage data streams.  A stream is a potentially unbounded, thus the S2R operators extracts finite bags of timestamped data items, transforming streams in relations. There are several operators of this class and the sliding window is one of the most studied. 

The next operator belong to the second class. It is the Relation-to-Relation (R2R). The relation may be transformed in another relation through relational algebraic expressions, which are a well-known cases of this class of operators. 

Finally, the third operator, from last class, is the Relation-to-Stream (R2S). It is necessary when the output of the query processor should be a stream. The transformed relation has to be set as output trough this an additional operator, the R2R, which appends the set of mappings to the output stream. Every time the continuous query is evaluated, the set of solution mappings is processed by the R2S operator, which determines the data items it has to stream out. There are usually three R2S operators:

\textbf{Rstream}, which streams out the computed timestamped set of mappings at each step. Rstream answers can be verbose as the same solution mapping can be computed at different evaluation times, and consequently streamed out. It is suitable when it is important to have the whole SPARQL query answer at each step, e.g. discover museum attractions that are popular in a social network in the recent time period.

\textbf{Istream} streams out the difference between the timestamped set of mappings computed at the last step and the one computed at the previous step. Answers are usually short (they contain only the differences) and consequently this operator is used when data exchange is expensive. Istream is useful when the focus in on the new mappings that are computed by the system, e.g. discover emerging museum attractions in a social network.

\textbf{Dstream} does the opposite of Istream: it streams out the difference between the computed timestamped set of mappings at the previous step and at the last step. Dstream is normally considered less relevant than Rstream and Istream, but it can be useful, e.g. to retrieve attractions that are no more popular.


\subsection{Complex Event Processor}\label{sec:cep}

The Complex Event Processing (CEP)  finds its origins in the publish-subscribe domain \cite{Eugster:2003:MFP:857076.857078}. It comes from interpreting IFP items as notifications of events which arrive from  external world.  However, CEP systems differ from the traditional publish-subscribes ones, which handle separately each incoming event, filtering at topic level or at content level to decide if an event is relevant for subscribers. The aim of a Complex Event Processing systems is filtering and combining the events to understand what is happening in terms of higher-level information. Thus, the focus of the CEP model is on detecting occurrences of particular event patterns that represent the higher-level information. For this reason, CEP systems increase the expressive power of the subscription language to consider complex event patterns that involve the occurrence of multiple, related events \cite{Cugola:2012:PFI:2187671.2187677}.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/cep}
	\caption{CEP Model proposed in \cite{Cugola:2012:PFI:2187671.2187677}  } 
  	\label{fig:cep}
\end{figure}

A CEP Engine, Figure \ref{fig:cep}, is responsible for processing such events as explained above, in order understand what is happening in terms of higher-level information to be notified to sinks, which act as event consumers. CEP systems are designed to face the main limitation of most DSMSs: the ability to detect complex patterns of incoming items, involving sequencing and ordering relationships. The CEP model relies on the ability to identify event patterns that match incoming event notifications on the basis of their content and on some ordering relationships on them.


\section{Stream Reasoning}\label{sec:sfp}

Answering such queries like \textit{What are the top 10 emerging topics under discussion on Twitter, and who is driving the discussions?} requires systems that can manage rapidly changing worlds at the semantic level. \textbf{Stream Reasoning} is a novel research trend focused on combining DSMS , which can analyse data on the fly (see Section \ref{sec:dsms}) and reasoners, which can perform such complex reasoning tasks (see Section \ref{sec:sw}), in order to make possible reasoning on rapidly changing information.

A first step toward stream reasoning \cite{DBLP:conf/fis/ValleCBBC08} tries to combine the power of existing data stream management systems and the Semantic Web. In the context LarKC European Research Project\footnote{http://www.larkc.eu} \cite{4597242, 4120457} was proposed a pluggable algorithmic framework for a such a system, which includes the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] \textit{retrieve} relevant resources from the incoming input stream by a selection step, where the information is filtered
\item[2.] \textit{abstract} by extracting information, calculating statistics and transforming from fine grain data streams into aggregated events.
\item[3.] \textit{select} relevant problems/methods/data;
\item[4.] \textit{reason} upon the aggregated knowledge; 
\item[5.] \textit{decide} on the base of some decision criteria, defined by the application developer, if the quality of the answer is good enough or if a new iteration is needed.
\end{itemize} 


\subsection{RDF Stream}\label{sec:rdfstream}

Either for doing the abstraction step (1), or immediately after the abstraction, data streams are consolidated as \textit{RDF streams}, which are data streams where the data items are modelled through RDF~\footnote{Cf. \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-primer-20040210/}.} (one or more RDF statements). For example, let's consider the following stream: at time 1, an event $e_1$ states that an article \textit{:paper$_1$} is written by \textit{:alice}, while at time 5, a data item $e_2$ states that \textit{:paper$_2$} is written by \textit{:bob}. The stream $((e_1,1),(e_2,5))$ can be represented by the following RDF stream:

\vspace{5pt}
\noindent\textit{(:paper$_1$ ub:publicationAuthor :alice), 1}\\
\textit{(:paper$_2$ ub:publicationAuthor :bob), 5}
\vspace{5pt}

Initial works on RDF Stream formalization proposed two alternative formats \cite{DBLP:conf/fis/ValleCBBC08}:
\begin{itemize}
\item RDF molecules stream - it is an unbounded bag of pairs $< \rho, \tau >$, where $\rho$ is a RDF molecule \cite{TrackingMolecules} and $\tau$ is the timestamp that denotes the logical arrival time of RDF molecule $\rho$ on the stream \cite{DBLP:conf/fis/ValleCBBC08};
\item RDF statements stream, is a special case of RDF molecules stream in which $\rho$ is an RDF statement instead of an RDF molecule  .
\end{itemize} 

The single RDF statement representation for events was exploited in different works  \cite{Barbieri2010,Lephuoc2011}, while more recent researches \cite{DBLP:conf/semweb/BalduiniVDTPC13} are studying the cases where events are modelled through RDF graphs (i.e. set of RDF statements). 

The  RDF stream  definition is based on the relational data stream one. \textit{RDF streams are sequences of timestamped data items, where a data item is a self- consumable informative unit}. Some the main characteristics of relational data streams still hold \cite{DBLP:conf/pods/BabcockBDMW02}, thus RDF Stream are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{continuous}: new data items are continuously added to the stream;
\item \textbf{potentially unbounded} : a data stream could be infinite;
\item \textbf{transient}: it is not always possible to store data streams in secondary memory;
\item \textbf{ordered}: data items are intrinsically characterised by recency.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Continuous Extension of SPARQL}\label{sec:continuous-sparql}

There are many extension of SPARQL, which extends the SPARQL 1.1 (see Section \ref{sec:sparql}) to include continuous operators (see Section \ref{sec:dsms}):

Continuous SPARQL (C-SPARQL)  is a language for continuous queries over streams of RDF data that extends SPARQL 1.1 \cite{Barbieri:2010:QRS:1860702.1860705}.

Another example is CQELS-QL \cite{Le-Phuoc:2011:NAA:2063016.2063041} – a declarative query language built from SPARQL 1.1 gram- mar. As C-SPARQL, it extends SPARQL with operators to query streams. The main difference between C-SPARQL and CQELS-QL is in the R2S operator supported: CQELS-QL supports only Istream, whereas C-SPARQL supports only Rstream. 

Last but not least, SPARQLstream \cite{Calbimonte:2010:EOA:1940281.1940289} is another extension of SPARQL that supports operators over RDF streams such as time windows. Unlike CQELS and the C-SPARQL Engine, SPARQLstream supports all the streaming operators presented in Section 2.3.4. The language is adopted in morph-streams: it is an RDF stream query processor that uses Ontology-Based Data Access techniques [15] for the continuous execution of SPARQLstream queries against virtual RDF streams that logically represent re- lational data streams.

\subsection{RDF Stream Processing Engine}\label{sec:rspengine}

Sections above report that RDF Stream Processing has three basic building blocks: 1) RDF streams, we introduced in Section \ref{sec:rdfstream} 2) continuos extensions of SPARQL, a brief description in Section \ref{sec:continuous-sparql}, and 3) reasoning algorithms able to cope with rapidly changing information.

Collectively engines that process RDF streams using those SPARQL extensions and reasoning algorithm are known as \textbf{RDF Stream Processing} (RSP) \textbf{Engines}.

Among RSP Engines, we target window-based RSP engines, i.e. processors whose \textbf{continuous query language} allows to open sliding windows to capture segments of RDF streams. The C-SPARQL Engine\footnote{\url{https://github.com/streamreasoning/CSPARQL-engine}}, Sparkwave \cite{DBLP:conf/debs/KomazecCF12}, CQELS \cite{Lephuoc2011}, and Morph$_{stream}$ \cite{Calbimonte2012}  are examples of window-based RSP engines.  The first two processes C-SPARQL~\cite{Barbieri2010}, continuous queries, where as the second two proposes their own extensions (respectively, CQELS-QL and SPARQL$_{stream}$). The first two can also process C-SPARQL queries under RDFS entailment regime\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-entailment/#RDFSEntRegime}}. For instance, the following  following C-SPARQL query asks to report every day the people mentioned during the last week in the stream of those who have published a paper:

\vspace{5pt}
\noindent\textit{SELECT ?person}\\
\textit{FROM STREAM <http://www.ex.org/lubm-stream> [RANGE 1w STEP 1d]}\\
\textit{WHERE \{?person a ub:Person\}}
\vspace{5pt}

The requested information is not explicitly stated, but being the range of the \textit{ub:publicationAuthor} property a \textit{ub:Person}, an RDFS reasoner can deduce it and, thus, it can allow to answer the query.

The logical processing model of RSP Engines follows the one initially proposed in DSMS and it is composed by three logical steps\footnote{Physical evaluation may differ from this logical steps.}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] A portion of the RDF stream is logically selected using a sliding window operator; This is the \textbf{stream-to-relation} step. 
\item[2.] The WHERE clause of the query is evaluated (including the possibly required reasoning tasks) and a sequences of solution mappings are produced, this is the \textbf{relation-to-relation} step.
\item[3.] Solution mappings are transformed back in timestamped elements and are appended to the output, this is the \textbf{relation-to-stream} step 
\end{itemize}


\section{Empirical Research}\label{sec:empirical-research}

The problem of understating the nature of the Computer Science (CS) research has one stronghold in Tichy's work of 1995 \cite{Tichy:1995:EEC:209090.209093}. He and his collaborator evaluated 400 articles published in 1993 randomly selected papers form ACM (50) and from a few journals in Systems and Software Engineering. The aim of Tichy's research was classify and define Computer Scientist research habits, proposing the following taxonomy, quoting from \cite{Tichy:1995:EEC:209090.209093}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Formal theory}: articles whose main contributions are formally tractable propositions, e.g., lemmata and theorems and their proofs.
\item \textit{Design and modelling}: systems, techniques, or models, whose claimed properties cannot be proven formally. Examples include software tools, performance prediction models, and complex hardware and software systems of all kinds. The papers in this class were further classified in the categories 0\%, 0–10\%, 10– 20\%, 20–50\, and +50\%, according to the proportion of the paper that was dedicated to the evaluation of the new system, technique, or model.
\item \textit{Empirical work}: articles that collect, analyse, and interpret observations about known designs, systems, or models, or about abstract theories or subjects (as this paper does). The emphasis is on evaluation, not on new designs or models.
\item \textit{Hypothesis testing}: articles that define hypotheses and describe experiments to test them.
\item \textit{Others}: articles that do not fit any of the four categories above, e.g., surveys.
\end{itemize}

Practically, an empirical study is just a test that compares what we believe to what we observe. The Testing activity, when properly designed and executed can be used to support the scientific method and rather plays a fundamental role in modern science. Empirical study helps us understand how and why things work, and allow us to use this understanding to materially alter our world.

Tichy's evaluation of paper from 1993 shows that despite the Engineering epistemology of the majority of the evaluated paper, there was a lack in empirical evaluation of the proposed research. More recent works \cite{Wainer:2009:EEC:1518331.1518552} observed confirmed Tichy's observations about the Computer Science engineering epistemology, the amount of evaluation reported in the papers is low.

The main reason for this is that software engineering (SE), and Computer Science, research has failed to produce the models and analytical tools that are common in other sciences \cite{Perry:2000:ESS:336512.336586}. CS research lacks the knowledge about the mechanisms which drive the costs and benefits of software tools and methods, making hard to understand whether analysis are  based on faulty assumptions or the new evaluation methods are properly.

Finally,  it is important to remember that empirical studies can be used not only retrospectively to validate systems or idea after they have been implemented, but also proactively to direct our research. Formal experiments, case studies and prototyping exercises are all adequate empirical studies. Independently from their form, they are a key way to fill the lack and sustains our research with credible observations. Indeed empirical studies allow to learn something useful by comparing theory to reality trough the following steps \cite{Perry:2000:ESS:336512.336586}:
\begin{itemize}
\item  formulating an hypothesis or question to test
\item  observing a situation
\item  abstracting observations into data
\item  analysing the data
\item  drawing conclusions with respect to the tested hypothesis
\end{itemize}

\section{Software Testing}\label{sec:software-testing}
Software Testing (ST) techniques Starts with the intent of finding software bugs and ends with methods to evaluate system behaviour under testing conditions. In general software testing is an investigation over software products to evaluate the software quality. According to IEEE Standards  \cite{IEEEStd610.12-1990:glossary} there are two basic classes of software testing, black box testing and white box testing: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Black box testing [BBT] - it ignores the internal mechanisms of a system or component and focuses solely on the outputs
generated in response to selected inputs and execution conditions.
\item White box testing [WBT] - is takes into account the internal mechanism of a system or component. 
\end{itemize} 

Black-box testing  methods  examine the functionality of a system without peering into its internal structures or workings. BBT exploits test cases built around specifications and requirements of the software. An external descriptions of the software is mandatory, and it must also include software specifications, requirements and design parameters.  The test designer selects both valid and invalid inputs and determines the correct output without any knowledge of the test object's internal structure.

White-box testing  method instead exploits complete knowledge about software internal structures. In WBT an internal perspective of the system is required to design test cases. The test designer analyses the code, understand the expected output and chose input properly  to exercise paths he found. 

ST tries to offer an objective, independent view of the software, usually with Software Performance Testing, defined as  \textit{testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified performance requirements} \cite{IEEEStd610.12-1990:glossary}. Once  the key transactions and their data requirements are identified, the test designer creates a number of different types of performance tests, in order to evaluate different software characteristics. The design of the test follows the researcher needs about which behaviour evaluate. The choice depends on the nature of the application and how much time is available for performance testing. The following testing terms are generally well known in the industry \cite{Molyneaux:2009:AAP:1550832}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Load testing} - it is the simplest form of performance testing, its aim is to understand the behaviour of the system under an expected load (the load kind depends on the software system) and meet performance targets for availability, concurrency or throughput, and response time. This test will give out the response times of all the critical transactions and it can point out bottlenecks in the application software. Load testing is the closest approximation of real application use.

\item \textit{Stress testing} -  it is used to understand the upper limits of capacity of a system and determine the system's robustness in terms of extreme load. A stress test may causes the application or some part of the supporting infrastructure to fail. The results of this kind of test are  capacity measure as much as performance. It's important to understand software limitations, in order to face future growth of application traffic, which may be hard to predict.

\item \textit{ Soak testing} - it is performed to determine if the system can sustain the continuous expected load. It essentially involves applying a significant load to a system for an significant period of time. The goal is to discover how the system behaves under sustained use or identify steady state conditions. During soak tests, memory utilization is monitored to detect potential leaks. Also important, but often overlooked is performance degradation, i.e. to ensure that the throughput and/or response times after some long period of sustained activity are as good as or better than at the beginning of the test. 
\end{itemize} 

\section{Benchmarks}\label{sec:benchmarking}
A benchmark is a procedure, problem, or test that can be used to compare systems or components to each other or to a standard \cite{IEEEStd610.12-1990:glossary}. Benchmarking is the primary method for measuring the performance of a systems, hardware or an application[7]. Benchmark results are used to evaluate the performance of a given system on a well-defined workload \cite{Menasce:2001:CPW:560806}.

Many benchmark tests exists to evaluate a wide variety system or applications under under different types of workloads. The user groups like the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) \footnote{http://www.tpc.org/information},  a non-profit corporation founded to define transaction processing and database benchmarks, or analogues corporations are useful resources of be informed about updated types of benchmarks. 

Generic benchmarks allows the quantitative comparison of system performances or price/cost. In database context performance is typically a throughput metric (work/second) and price is typically a five-year cost-of-ownership metric. The quantitative comparison requires the benchmark to be run on several different systems and to record each system is measurements.  The estimation evaluated from results is usually the relative system performance, because the cost of implementing and measuring a specific application on many different systems is almost always prohibitive.

\subsection{Domain Specifc Benchmarks}  \label{sec:tcp}

A single metric can not measure the performance relative to all application of a computer systems \cite{DBLP:books/mk/Gray93}. Performances depend striclty on the application domain, because each system is designed for a few problem in a domain and may be inadequate to perform other tasks.

It is worth to note the work of Jim Gray about Domain-specific benchmarks, a kind of benchmarking methods and tools  which responds to computer system diversity. A Domain-specific benchmark specifies a synthetic workload characterizing typical applications in that problem domain. 

In order to distinguish among several solution and workload, Gray states four key criteria that a Domain-Specific Benchmark must meet to be useful\cite{DBLP:books/mk/Gray93}. It must be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Relevant: It must measure the peak performance and price/performance of systems when performing typical operations within that problem domain.
\item Portable: It should be easy to implement the benchmark on many different systems and architectures.
Gray: Introduction 3
\item Scalable: The benchmark should apply to small and large computer systems. It should be possible to scale the benchmark up to larger systems, and to parallel computer systems as computer performance and architecture evolve.
\item Simple: The benchmark must be understandable, otherwise it will lack credibility.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Reasoning Benchmark}\label{sec:lubm}

The number of different reasoners available is increasing and many of them are already commercial solutions. Usually reasoner are able to process very expressive ontology languages, which can represent rather complete knowledge, however there is an high demand of  less expressive ontology languages, which are less expensive in term of reasoning or other computational tasks. Commercial reasoner tries to solve the issue called \textit{computational cliff}, they face the trade-off between \textit{complexity and expressiveness} versus \textit{scalability}. Benchmarking tools are useful to evaluate reasoning system w.r.t. ontology languages 
\cite{bock2008benchmarking}. The most important Benchmark suite is the Lehigh University Benchmark  (LUBM) \cite{Guo2005}. This work proposes a  method for benchmarking Semantic Web knowledge base systems and provide an example of such a benchmarks.

Reasoning benchmarking environment requires:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ontology: LUBM exploits a synthetic ontology named Univ-Bench\footnote{http://www.lehigh.edu/~zhp2/2004/0401/univ-bench.owl} ,which describes universities, departments and the activities that occur at them. However, the popularity of OWL is high and that
many more ontologies are now available, and recent automated benchmarking tools allow testing performance with such ontologies\cite{gardiner2006automated}.

\item Workload: LUBM provides an random data generator, called UBA (Univ-Bench Artificial data generator), which creates extensional data over the Univ-Bench ontology \cite{Guo2005}.

\item Queries: LUBM comes with fourteen test queries to test the reasoning capabilities over the workload. LUBM method contains criteria for query definition which consider for example \textit{Input size} or \textit{Complexity} to stress the reasoner and evaluate performances.
\end{itemize}

Finally, Reasoning benchmarking require to understand which metrics evaluate such a system \cite{Guo2005}. LUBM contains three metrics which are commonly used in other database benchmarks.\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Load Time,the stand alone elapsed time for storing the specified dataset to the system};
\item \textit{Repository Size, the resulting size of the repository after loading the specified benchmark data into the system};
\item \textit{Query Response Time}, as in databases benchmarking, for each test query the evaluation consist in:
  	1) Open the repository; 2) Execute the query for 10 times and compute the average response time. 3) Close the repository
\end{itemize}

LUBM contains also two specific reasoning metrics: \textit{Query Completeness and Soundness}: partial answering is possible in semantic web, indeed LUBM evaluate the \textit{degree of completeness of each query answer as the percentage of the entailed answers that are returned by the system is also evaluated}. Moreover, LUBM also provides a metric for measuring the combination of  query response time and answer completeness and soundness, to  appreciate the potential trade-off.

\subsection{DSMS \& CEP Benchmarking}\label{sec:linear-road}

Initial work on Streaming data like Linear Road \cite{arasu2004linear} firstly poses  several challenges to the design of a benchmark.  Moreover, the variety of CEP and DSMS domains and the lack of standards in query languages and data formats extends these benchmark design challenges. First of all DSMS Benchmarking must consider the challenges presented in the Linear Road work:
\begin{itemize}
\item  \textit{Semantically Valid Input} -  Input data can not be randomized but should have some semantic validity.
\item  \textit{Continuous Query Performance Metrics} - Standard DBMS time to completion metrics is inadequate. Query Response Time and Supported Query Load 
\item  \textit{Results Correctness} - benchmark implementations must be validated w.r.t the queries, which influence the results, to ensure that results are consistent with the benchmark specifications 
\item  \textit{Query Language Independence}: no standard query language for streaming systems exist, thus the query requirements must be language independent
\end{itemize}

Linear Road meets all the challenges above by design. The benchmark consist into a simulation of  an urban highways system where toll charges are dynamically determined. The Input data contains a stream of position reports, which specify the location of a vehicle every 30 seconds, and historical query requests, which may be issued by a vehicle with some fixed probability every time it emits a position report.

Further works, like the BiCEP project\footnote{http://bicep.dei.uc.pt} try to identify some o requirements for CEP benchmarking and develop a synthetic benchmarking set to measure the event processing activity such systems. CEP Benchmarking are evaluated with Jim Gray criteria presented in Section \ref{sec:tcp}. 

\begin{figure}[tbh]
  \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/bicep_schema}
	\caption{BiCEP system  modules and the CEP engine} 
  	\label{fig:bicep-schema}
\end{figure}

BiCEP project also presents an first schema model for a benchmarking system, reported in Figure \ref{fig:bicep-schema}. The BiCEP benchmarking system will produce all the input trough the Event Generator Module, and consume the result output from the BiCEP CEP engine, with the Answer Validation Module. The Figure above also show how the CEP engine in interfaced with BiCEP modules, in order to ensure that any buffering, event cleaning or event transformation phase that happens at the CEP engine is part of the overall performance measure. Synthetic benchmarks offers many benefits like data availability, experimental control, and scalability. However, it is is hard to develop a synthetic benchmark that is representative of such a wide range of CEP applications and at the same time. BiCEP development is oriented towards a set of small domain specific synthetic benchmarks with different data sets and different queries \cite{bizarro:DSP:2007:1143}.

Finally, BiCEP project presents a set of metrics for CEP benchmarking, the most relevant ones in performance evaluation context are: \textit{Response time}: the time since the last event of some event pattern is fed into the system until the system notifies the event pattern detection. \textit{Scalability} in order to compare system with different scale levels; \textit{Adaptivity} the system response to input variation is mandatory, because CEP system rarely face stable input streams that allow the CEP engine to reach a steady state condition.

\subsection{Semantic Flow Processing (SFP) Benchmark}\label{sec:sr-benchmarking}

Section \ref{sec:empirical-research} shows how the empirical evaluation of system is increasing its relevance in the computer science context. SFP systems are complex and heterogeneous and this enforce the need of such empirical evaluation. However,  despite the increasing number of SFP engines, the works about SFP system evaluation are still limited and do not address proper definition of the key performance indicators (see Section \ref{sec:sfp}), making harder any comparison of  the different systems.

For this reason is worth to note the work on SFP benchmarking, which following the Linear Road example. It firstly poses the main challenges for the SR research filed and then it faces one by one, posing seven commandments to follow on the benchmarking design for SFP \cite{DBLP:conf/esws/ScharrenbachUMVB13}:

Semantic Flow Processing engines must implement good \textit{Load Balancing} [S.1] strategies, because they usually consider several input information streams with possible bursts. It is possible to stress the system under various conditions by repeatedly applying a set of changes to the input and provide the empirical evaluation.

A stress test is required to measure the performance of \textit{Flow Data Joins And Inference} [S.2]. It has to consider increasingly complex cascades of joins in order to design the stress test for Simple joins, which put no further constraints on the join but the join-equality. The benchmark must have to add further constraints on the joins, and subsequently to  the data to enable testing Sequential joins, which add a sequential constrains, and Temporal joins, which extend sequential joins by enabling advanced temporal constraints. On the other and, \textit{joining stream and background data} [S.3] always results in simple joins. A stress-test must consider single joins and increasingly complex cascades.

The benchmark must test \textit{Aggregates} [S.4], which enable, on groups of entities or literals, counts, averages and any other arithmetic operation, trough properly scale groups: group number, group complexity or tuning the data to provide a big number of candidate but a small number of selected groups.

In distributed settings, SFP must ensure the correctness of query answers, handling \textit{Unexpected Data} [S.5] like out-of-order arrival of information and data loss.  A benchmark can measure this ability evaluating precision and recall of the amount of missing data with two tests, by increasing the number of out-of-order events (i) or by testing how long or how many data can be handled until some nosily data observation will be no longer considered for processing(ii).

A benchmarks has two possibility for stressing the system trough \textit{Schema} [S.6] variations: evaluating the system ability to handle an increasing number of of axioms in system ontology, notice that it is fundamental to add new axioms that could not have been deduced from existing ones. Changing statements that generate a more complex reasoning, it is important to know that increase the expressive power of the schema not only for the background data but also of the data flow may stress an SFP system significantly.

Finally, a benchmark should evaluate an SFP engine trough \textit{Changes in Background-Data} [S.7]. Any stress test on changes in background data should variate the update frequency and the entire amount of data involved in the update, forcing the system to access background-data from disk as much as possible.

Implemented proposal for SFP benchmarking has been published but none of them impact the community as the Linear Road did for DSMS. More careful analysis of those solutions, presented in the following section, evidence some lacks w.r.t proposed commandments \cite{DBLP:conf/esws/ScharrenbachUMVB13} 

\subsubsection{SRBench}\label{sec:srbench}

SRBench is presented as \textit{a general-purpose benchmark primarily designed for streaming RDF/SPARQL engines and based on real-world data sets}\cite{Zhang2012}. The SRBench dataset is composed by: the LinkedSensorData  which  is a real-world data set containing the US weather data published by Kno.e.sis\footnote{ http://knoesis.wright.edu};  GeoNames and DBpedia data sets, which allow to demostrate the ability of the benchmarked system to deal with interlinked data.

Moreover, \cite{Zhang2012} provides some relevant metrics to evaluate the performance of the system: \begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Correctness of the query results} - it must be validated and the validation results should be expressed in terms of precision and recall
\item \textit{Throughput} - it is defined as limit number of incoming data  an SFP system is able to process per time unit.
\item \textit{Scalability} - it means evaluating how the system reacts to an increasing number of incoming streams and variation on number of registered continuous queries.
\item \textit{Response time} - it is the amount of time between a data item enters the system and the SFP engine outputs the query results.
\end{itemize}

SR Bench provides also a query set composed by seventeen queries, which are designed based on a real use case in LSD. In order test many properties of the RDF stream engines the queries vary involving single or multiple input streams, queries over stream-only data sources or over mixed stream and static data source, etc. They cover the most important SPARQL operators and the common streaming SPARQL extensions and several queries require RDFS reasoning.

SRBench was criticised w.r.t. proposed commandments above \cite{DBLP:conf/esws/ScharrenbachUMVB13}. It only cover S.3, but the queries are fixed  and thus do not allow an exhaustive assessment of join performance, and S.6, thus testing variations of the expressive power is possible in SR but it was not done yet. Moreover, S.2 and S.4 are partially satisfied. The SRBench provides data and use-cases for sequential joins but it does not implement stress tests for temporal joins[S.2]. About S.4, SRBench  tests aggregates  by only implementing single queries. The other commandments are not cover yes, even if some of was marked as potential extensions of SRBench in \cite{DBLP:conf/esws/ScharrenbachUMVB13} Table 1.

\subsubsection{LSBench}\label{sec:lsbench}

LS Bench was developed to propose methods and a framework to enable  meaningful comparisons of SFP processing engines. The framework provides several customizable tools for simulating realistic data, running engines, and analysing the output. 

The LSBench proposed methods includes three tests to evaluate the SFP stream engines \cite{DBLP:conf/semweb/DellAglioCBCV13}. \begin{itemize}
\item A functional test to verify the operators and the functionalities supported
by the engines, similar to SR Bench \ref{sec:srbench}
\item A correctness test is to verify if the tested SFP engine produces the correct output. Actually the test assumes that the contents of the output are correct, and it analyses only the number of produced answers.
\item A maximum input throughput test, whose aim is evaluating the maximum throughput of the SFP engine, by increasing the data streak rate and checking the number of the answers
\end{itemize}

%\subsubsection{LSBench} S2 partially, S3 partially, S4 partially 

The data generator, S2Gen, creates data set for benchmarking according to the \textit{Social Network Data Stream Logic Schema} presented in \cite{LePhuoc2012c} Figure 1. S2Gen allow to tune three parameters which influence the data generation task: 1) \textit{Generating period}, the period in which the social activities are generated; 2) Maximum number of posts/comments/photos for each user per week 3) the \textit{Correlation probabilities}: there are various parameters for the data correlations which can be customized to specify how data is related according to each data attribute.

Finally, LSBench \cite{LePhuoc2012c} provides for each test a set of 12 fixed queries. The queries in the set vary to address different features of the engines. In relation with the Seven commandments for SFP benchmarking, not all of the are covered by LS Bench \cite{DBLP:conf/esws/ScharrenbachUMVB13} Table 1. LSBench cover S3, like SRBench fixed queries do not allow to stress the system properly with the aim of evaluate join performances. S2 is only partially supported, because, like SRBench, LS Bench does not support stress testing for temporal joins but only for sequential. S4 is again only partially fulfilled: LS Bench test aggregates only implementing single queries  \cite{DBLP:conf/esws/ScharrenbachUMVB13}.

\subsubsection{Benchmarking Query Result Correctness: CSRBench}

Further work on correctness of the RSP Engine operational semantics, showed how this may variate on different implementations and influence the query results correctness. \cite{DBLP:conf/semweb/DellAglioCBCV13}

One common limitation of the Stream Reasoning benchmarks presented above is that they do not check the correctness of output produced by the benchmarked RDF engine. SRBench verifies the query language supported by the engines defines only trough functional tests. On the other hand, LSBench does not check the answers correctness, but limits the analysis of correctness to the number of outputs. 
SR Bench and LS Bench make two assumptions on the tested systems: (i) they work correctly; (ii) They all have the same operational semantics. However, these assumptions do not always hold for all RDF stream engines, and hence these benchmarks may supply misleading information about them.
 
An extension of the SR Bench for correctness checking, CSRBench, was proposed in \cite{DBLP:conf/semweb/DellAglioCBCV13}. It takes into account the issues that affect query results in RDF streaming query processing in their three main dimensions: system, query and input stream data.It includes in the benchmark three new types of parametrised queries, with the aim of stressing the S2R operators. Moreover, it contains an oracle that generates and compares results of RDF stream processors and check their correctness.
