@inproceedings{oezcep14streamDL,
  abstract = {The paper contributes to the recent efforts on temporalizing and streamifiying ontology based data access (OBDA) by discussing aspects of rewritability, i.e., compilability of the TBox into ontology-level queries,   and unfoldability, i.e., transformability  of ontology-level queries to queries  on datasource level, for the new query-language framework STARQL. The distinguishing feature  of STARQL is its  general stream windowing and ABox sequencing strategy which allows it to plugin well-known query languages such as unions of conjunctive queries (UCQs)  in combination with TBox languages such as DL-Lite and do temporal reasoning with a sorted first-order logic on top of them. 
The paper discusses safety aspects under which STARQL queries that embed UCQs over DL-Lite ontologies can be rewritten and unfolded   to back-end relational stream query languages such as CQL.  With these results, the adoption of description logic technology in industrially relevant application areas such as industrial monitoring is crucially fostered.},
